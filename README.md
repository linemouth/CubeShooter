# Cubism
This is an introductory Unity project in which we use some primitive shapes to explore the basic features of the game engine.

## Cloning this Project
Open a Git Bash terminal where you want your Unity projects to live. Enter the following command:
```bash
git clone <URL>
```
where URL is the link you copy from the green ```<> Code``` button on this page.

## Opening the Project
You may open Unity Hub and click Open to add this project to your projects list. Now, open it in the Unity editor. If you don't have the correct version of editor installed, it will ask if you want to install it. You can also try using an editor you already have. If you change the editor, the project will likely still work, especially for simple things like this. However, on more complex projects that were made with a much older or newer editor, some things will likely break.
